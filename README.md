# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

. In this project,we use python to create and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk.

. in this project explained how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.

. Create training and test groups from a given data set.

. Implement the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.

. Interpret the results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.

. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.

. Use ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance
